// Purpose: The GunData Asset is a robust and straightforward tool that is responsible for defining individual weapon characteristics. 
//          It handles weapon settings all in one place and effectively communicates with the Gun script creating seamless weapon tweaking.
//          Anything related with weapon performance such as: Shooting settings, Magazine Settings, Accuracy settings,
//          and even characteristics of a weapon such as weight and melee force is handled within a gun's respective GunData Asset.
