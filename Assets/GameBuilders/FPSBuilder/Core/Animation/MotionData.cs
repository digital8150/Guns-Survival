// Purpose: The Motion Data Asset contains all data used to perform procedural motion for the respective player state,
// affecting both camera and player weapons. These procedural animation controllers are focused on the walking
// and running motion within these different states having unique values in mind to stress a player state.
// (i.e. whilst the player is running, naturally, amplitude curves and general values of intensity are increased
// as motion while running logically would become more erratic. The opposite for the more subtle state of walking).
